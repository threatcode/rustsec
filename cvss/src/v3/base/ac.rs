/// Attack Complexity (AC) - CVSS v3.1 Base Metric Group
///
/// Described in CVSS v3.1 Specification: Section 2.1.2:
/// <https://www.first.org/cvss/specification-document#t6>
///
/// > This metric describes the conditions beyond the attackerâ€™s control that
/// > must exist in order to exploit the vulnerability. As described below,
/// > such conditions may require the collection of more information about the
/// > target, or computational exceptions. Importantly, the assessment of this
/// > metric excludes any requirements for user interaction in order to exploit
/// > the vulnerability (such conditions are captured in the User Interaction
/// > metric). If a specific configuration is required for an attack to
/// > succeed, the Base metrics should be scored assuming the vulnerable
/// > component is in that configuration. The Base Score is greatest for the
/// > least complex attacks.

    /// > That is, a successful attack cannot be accomplished at will, but requires
    /// > the attacker to invest in some measurable amount of effort in preparation
    /// > or execution against the vulnerable component before a successful attack
    /// > can be expected. For example, a successful attack may depend on an
    /// > attacker overcoming any of the following conditions:
    /// >
    /// > - The attacker must gather knowledge about the environment in which
    /// >   the vulnerable target/component exists. For example, a requirement
    /// >   to collect details on target configuration settings, sequence numbers,
    /// >   or shared secrets.
    /// > - The attacker must prepare the target environment to improve exploit
    /// >   reliability. For example, repeated exploitation to win a race
    /// >   condition, or overcoming advanced exploit mitigation techniques.
    /// > - The attacker must inject themselves into the logical network path
    /// >   between the target and the resource requested by the victim in order
    /// >   to read and/or modify network communications (e.g., a man in the middle
    /// >   attack).
