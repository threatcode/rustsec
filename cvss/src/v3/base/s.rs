/// Scope (S) - CVSS v3.1 Base Metric Group
///
/// Described in CVSS v3.1 Specification: Section 2.2:
/// <https://www.first.org/cvss/specification-document#t8>
///
/// > The Scope metric captures whether a vulnerability in one vulnerable
/// > component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.
/// >
/// > Formally, a security authority is a mechanism (e.g., an application,
/// > an operating system, firmware, a sandbox environment) that defines and
/// > enforces access control in terms of how certain subjects/actors
/// > (e.g., human users, processes) can access certain restricted
/// > objects/resources (e.g., files, CPU, memory) in a controlled manner.
/// > All the subjects and objects under the jurisdiction of a single security
/// > authority are considered to be under one security scope. If a
/// > vulnerability in a vulnerable component can affect a component which is
/// > in a different security scope than the vulnerable component, a Scope
/// > change occurs. Intuitively, whenever the impact of a vulnerability
/// > breaches a security/trust boundary and impacts components outside the
/// > security scope in which vulnerable component resides, a Scope change occurs.
/// >
/// > The security scope of a component encompasses other components that
/// > provide functionality solely to that component, even if these other
/// > components have their own security authority. For example, a database
/// > used solely by one application is considered part of that applicationâ€™s
/// > security scope even if the database has its own security authority,
/// > e.g., a mechanism controlling access to database records based on
/// > database users and associated database privileges.
/// >
/// > The Base Score is greatest when a scope change occurs.
